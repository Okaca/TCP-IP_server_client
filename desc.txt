Using the TCP/IP protocol, develop a desktop application that can send and receive messages with the message contents provided in the table below. Develop the application using C# Windows Forms.

The details of the expected user interface are as follows:

The application must be able to operate either as a server or a client, based on the user's preference.

The user interface should allow the user to enter the content of each field in the defined messages and send them to the connected party.

The application must log all incoming and outgoing messages in a list on the user interface, along with the timestamp and message name.
(Note: If the message is sent, it should be prefixed with “Transmit”; if it is received, it should be prefixed with “Receive”.)

The user interface should allow the user to select any message from the message list and display its contents.

If the application receives a defined message from the other side, it should respond as follows:
If Message 1 is received, it should send Message 2.
If Message 2 is received, it should send Message 1.

If the application receives an undefined message, it should notify the user that the message is not recognized.

The application should also have the ability to send defined messages at specified intervals when desired.
This feature should be activated based on the user’s selection.
For example, the user should be able to choose to send Message 1 every 100 ms and Message 2 every 500 ms.

During the presentation, the application will be run with one instance as the Server and another as the Client.
These two instances will connect to each other and send/receive defined messages to test that the application works correctly.
